# Tajpad

Tajpad (pronounced like pad Thai with the words swapped around) is a website to practice and test your typing speed. It is inspired by [10fastfingers](http://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/). The main difference is that you can type continously and it will record your score every minute. It has a highscore table which is stored in your browser’s local storage so you don’t need to make an account.

You can use the website directly at [bpeel.github.io/tajpad](http://bpeel.github.io/tajpad/)
